# Features and Implementation
We will achieve our goals by the use of Pomodoro Technique effectively in which we break down work into short intervals, typically 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks. It helps individuals stay focused and avoid burnout by breaking up work into manageable chunks. It also helps to combat procrastination by encouraging individuals to work on a task for a set amount of time, rather than trying to complete the task all at once.

Also a person can make a todo-lists of tasks to be done and see if they are achieving their expected progress in the desired time or not. When the pomodoro timer is running, a user won't be able to visit the websites they think that will distract them from focusing which will be done by blocking the sites.
