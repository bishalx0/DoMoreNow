DoMoreNow is for people who want to gain further insight into how they are using their time, achieve more in a day and visualize their progress all while boosting their productivity.

# Background
Being a student/worker isn’t easy with distractions all around us, it isn’t surprising that many of us find it challenging to organize our time or stay focused on our studies and work. As a person who wants to do best in tasks, time management is not only an essential skill to find success in your academics, but it also allows you to make time for other passions, and to take care of yourself and your mental health. So by DoMoreNow we are helping a person one step closer to achieving their goals in carrer growth.

1. Creating a distraction free learning and growth platform for students/professionals

3. Tracking a students progress and their productivity

# Features and Implementation
We will achieve our goals by the use of Pomodoro Technique effectively in which we break down work into short intervals, typically 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks. It helps individuals stay focused and avoid burnout by breaking up work into manageable chunks. It also helps to combat procrastination by encouraging individuals to work on a task for a set amount of time, rather than trying to complete the task all at once.

Also a person can make a todo-lists of tasks to be done and see if they are achieving their expected progress in the desired time or not. When the pomodoro timer is running, a user won't be able to visit the websites they think that will distract them from focusing which will be done by blocking the sites.
